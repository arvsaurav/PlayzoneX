# PlayzoneX
A full-stack web application designed to book turf based on slot availability. The frontend is built with ReactJS, while Appwrite is used to handle the backend. Created Appwrite functions for real-time integration of Stripe payments. Implemented a slot blocking feature with a 5-minute timestamp to prevent simultaneous booking of the same slots by different users, ensuring data integrity and enhancing user satisfaction.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
